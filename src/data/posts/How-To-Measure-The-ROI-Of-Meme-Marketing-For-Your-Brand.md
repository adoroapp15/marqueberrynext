       <p>Memes are hilarious, but do they pay off? If you’re a brand manager staring at a budget spreadsheet, that’s the million-dollar question. The answer: yes, meme marketing delivers ROI—if you know how to measure it. At Marque Berry, we’ve cracked the code, and we’re sharing how to track the impact of your meme campaigns.</p>

      <p><strong>The Metrics That Matter</strong></p>
      <p>Start with engagement: likes, shares, comments. A meme that gets 500 retweets beats a $1,000 ad with 50 clicks any day. Next, track reach—impressions and views show how far your meme travels. Finally, conversions: clicks to your site, sign-ups, or sales tie it to the bottom line.</p>

      <p><strong>Real Results Speak</strong></p>
      <p>Take our client, a pet food brand. Their “when your dog hears the treat bag” meme hit 80K views, drove 5K site visits, and bumped sales 15% in a week. We tracked it with UTM links and Google Analytics—hard proof memes work. Engagement isn’t fluff; it’s a pipeline to profit.</p>
 
      <p><strong>Tools You Need</strong></p>
      <p>Google Analytics catches site traffic from meme links. Social platforms like X and Instagram offer built-in insights—watch for spikes after a drop. Want deeper data? Use Bitly for trackable URLs. We layer these tools to show clients exactly what’s working. </p>

      <p><strong>Beyond the Numbers</strong></p>
      <p>ROI isn’t just immediate cash. Memes build brand love—think loyalty, word-of-mouth, repeat buyers. A fitness brand we worked with saw a 20% follower jump from a meme series. That’s long-term value no ad can match.</p>

      <p><strong>Measure Smarter with Marque Berry</strong></p>
