    <p><strong>Introduction:</strong></p>
    <p><em>Bloody Daddy</em>, an Indian Hindi-language film starring Shahid Kapoor in the lead role as an anti-hero, is directed by Ali Abbas Zafar. This action thriller is hideously funny, unpredictable, brutal, and brave. At a time when content is evolving, characters are no longer strictly white or black but grey and realistic. Our task on the marketing end was to ensure the key message of the movie — that the character is flawed — was communicated clearly to the viewers.</p>

    <p><strong>Objective:</strong></p>
    <p>The strategy was to highlight Shahid Kapoor's ace acting performance and to emphasize that there is no absolute right or wrong — only wrong and a lesser wrong. The goal was to bond with the audience as an entertainer while recognizing that segments of society consist of flawed individuals who sometimes choose the lesser wrong. In simple terms, the objective was: acknowledge, accept, and converse.</p>

    <p><strong>Results:</strong></p>
    <p>&bull; Instagram Meme Reach: 20M+<br>&bull; Instagram Edit / Fan page Reach: 14M+<br>&bull; <em>Bloody Daddy</em> became the most viewed movie on the Jio Cinema app for two consecutive weeks.</p>

    <p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>
    <p>The campaign execution focused on increasing Shahid Kapoor's popularity and positioning him in mass-appeal films, highlighting the film's narrative, and reaching out to younger audiences and action lovers.<br>The social media posts included humorous content and recommendations that amplified the movie as a wholesome entertainer, not just another crime
